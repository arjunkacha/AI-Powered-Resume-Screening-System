Responsibilities:
Designed and developed an application to migrate legacy data to ASP.Net application by providing the ability to validate the data to meet
the business rules for the new application.
Design the story board using HTML and CSS and design database for applications by analyzing the customer requirements.
Perform code reviews of the modules developed by other team members and participate in pair programming to improve the coding
standards of the overall application.
Preparation of build packages and actively participate in integration and deployment phase of the applications. TECHNICALS SKILLS:
Programming Languages: C# Web Technologies: SharePoint 2010, ASP.NET 4.0/3.5/2.0, MVC 4 Application Software: Visual Studio
2008/2010/2013, SQL Server Management Studio Databases: SQL Server 2005/2008 R2, MySQL, Oracle Others: HTML, JQuery,
CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JIRA Source Controls: Team Foundation Sever, GitHub, Visual Source Safe PROJECTS AT WORK: 1)
LEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney. It is
also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project
was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding
additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on
certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax.
UBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee
id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will
decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception
records. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3)
Supplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of
seven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can
access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the
main communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL
Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two
parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The
existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and
approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to
capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to
validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a
web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an
ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk
data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data
that can be uploaded into each column. AWARDS AND PROFESSIONAL RECOGNITION:

I was hired to manage accreditation efforts for a major department modernization project involving 3 accreditation packages each leading to
successful Authorization To Operate decisions. Responsibilities then increased to include all departmental accreditation efforts leading to another 3
successful ATOs. Now, working on 4 new accreditation including re-authorization for an existing project. Succeeded in writing and implementing
vulnerability management for existing accredited systems. Success of the accreditation hinged on coordination with ONI Enterprise in critical design
decisions and to help the program integrate smoothly into the Enterprise thru many meetings, analyzing the Enterprise business model to understand
the best fit for the program. The different projects required careful management of specific STIG compliance and hardening for the different
configurations and services required for the specific domain to be integrated.Â Â  Analyzed complex computer systems to assess vulnerability and
risk.Â Â  Supervised 5 external computer consultants and vendors.Â Â  Managed application patches, data backup, security changes and

I was Hired to initiate processing strategies in fulfilling department analyst requirements. Requirements were fulfilled thru i dentifying product
problems and strengths and collected data on customer experienceÂ  and review of Enterprise compliance to transition to new technology for
supporting new processing needs thru proper processing power.Â  The next challengeÂ  came as storage requirements for better performance and
more controlled uses. After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was adopted to grow local
storage to over 200TB. In using this solution, the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and maintenance costs compared to the
alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed,
purchased and accredited for operation in the Enterprise.Â  Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from 30 hours to 30
minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru higher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru the traditional process.

department, I have had the opportunity to build my experience across grade levels and develop curriculum after curriculum to suit the needs of
students at various ages. As a result, I believe one of my greatest strengths is my understanding of the skills necessary at each grade level for
students to successfully exist high school career or college-ready.

In this small, family owned business there are a lot of hats to be worn. And with just 4 employees to run this store; a store manager, two
salespeople and our jeweler, this is not just a sales job.

I provided courteous and prompt service by greeting & welcoming customers, assisting them in locating what they're looking for and provided
excellent afterÂ​sales service by sending out thank you letters, birthday & anniversary reminders and followÂ​up calls to check in and see how
everything is going with their purchases.

I keep the behind the scenes of the store running smoothly by ordering all supplies; jewelry boxes, gift bags, watch batteries and all office and
shipping supplies. I assisted in ordering new merchandise for the store, picking new styles and creating new styles through our custom jewelry
design. I used POS data entry for all sales, customer contact information, research of transaction history and entering all inventory into the store
data base. I used Outlook for all email correspondence, Microsoft Word for all documents, Excel spreadsheet for inventory of certain items and
QuickBooks for payments. Other office functions included shipping via UPS, FedEx and USPS, scanning of documents, photo documentation for
appraisals, making photocopies, sending faxes and filing of paperwork, invoices and all vendor files. Create new vendor files and purge year end to
storage for safe keeping. I answered multiÂ​line telephone system, took messages, return calls and transfer appropriate calls to the owner.

Revenues grew from $48MM in 2008 to over $53MM in 2014.
This was due to the addition of two offices (one in Gig Harbor and one in Olympia) as well as additional modalities of treatment.
Achievements: Saved the company over $160,000 in 2015 due to hard negotiations with our Electronic Medical Record vendor due to
poor performance.
Saved the company over $120,000 annually by negotiating with the bank to lower interest rates on loans in early 2009.
Brought two construction projects, one for a new clinic with a $6.5MM budget and the other for an extensive remodel with a $4.5MM
budget, under budget and on time saving $200,000 in total.
Brought in a consultant to successfully turn the Board Meetings into efficient, professional meetings with strict agendas, time allotments for
each topic and rules of order.
Prior to that, the meetings were overly lengthy, ineffective and combative.
This resulted in fewer meetings, which have been far more effective.
Oversaw the opening of and addition of a Urology practice as well as the first mobile Brachytherapy unit in the State of WA (for the
treatment of various types of cancer).
Both contributed to an increase in revenues to the company of more than $1MM annually.
Successfully negotiated with two of the owners for buyouts on behalf of the Board.
One was amicable and the other was contentious.
This will result in cost savings to the company in excess of $1MM annually.

COLB was started in 1993 and has grown to an $8.5 billion dollar, 150+ branch community bank in WA, ORE and ID.
Recruited by and joined as Vice President and Commercial Banker with no loan portfolio 05/1998 Through aggressive sales
calls/marketing, grew portfolio to over $30MM in outstandings and $50MM in commitments in three years! This was accomplished with a
consistent and active marketing plan aimed at targeting well known businesses in the area as well as utilizing a strong referral base consisting
of lawyers, accountants and existing customers of the Bank.
Promoted to SVP due to growth of portfolio and fee income/referrals 06/2001 Promoted to SVP and SWWA Commercial Banking
Manager 06/2003 In this position, I was responsible for 8 commercial middle market lenders, whose territory stretched from Auburn to
Longview, WA.
While Columbia had started via a bank in Longview, it had been neglected from a commercial lending standpoint.
I spent considerable time and effort in working with the lending center there to establish a robust and larger presence.
Achievements: Overall TEAM portfolio grew from outstandings of $100MM to over $160MM in a highly competitive, charged
environment.
At one time this was the largest commercial market in the Bank (CB later entered Seattle, King County).
Implemented monthly sales meetings to emphasize consistent marketing and calling efforts, both with prospects and in cross-selling to
existing customers.
This resulted in deposit growth within the group from $100MM to over $200MM and fee income exceeding $1,200,000 annually.
Also during this time I was active in mentoring individual lenders, assisting with credit structure and pricing and calling on both prospects and
existing clients.
I worked hard to foster strong lines of communication and collaboration with other departments in the Bank who were our partners in
business development and instrumental in our success.
Was asked to join Loan Committee as a voting member.

June 2005

As my credit knowledge and responsibilities had grown, I was asked and approved to sit on the Bank's loan committee.
This was an opportune time to view all of the various types of credits that were presented.

In addition, during this time I was part of an assigned team to perform due diligence on potential bank purchases.
